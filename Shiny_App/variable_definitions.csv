Vitro_or_Vivo,Name,Label,Definition
vivo,PLA,Plasma,amount of drug found in plasma
vivo,ULU,Uninvolved Lung,amount of drug found in uninvolved lung // (part of the lung where there is no lesion).
vivo,RIM,Rim (of Lesion),amount of drug found in Rim (of lesion)
vivo,OCS,Outer Caseum,amount of drug found in outer caseum
vivo,ICS,Inner Caseum,amount of drug found in inner caseum
vivo,SLU,Standard Lung,amount of drug found in standard // lung EXCLUDING THE LESION
vivo,SLE,Standard Lesion,"amount of drug found in standard lesion // (JUST THE LESION, NO LUNG)"
vitro,cLogP,cLogP,octanol:water partition coefficient. This is the logarithm // of the concentration of drug in octanol (oil) and water - it's a // measure of lipohilicity/hydrophoicity of the drug.
vitro,huPPB,Human Plasma Binding,"The fraction of drug concentration that binds to human // plasma proteins, (1 - huPPB) is then the free concentration of // the drug."
vitro,muPPB,Mouse Plasma Binding,"the fraction of drug concentration that binds to mouse // plasma proteins, (1 - muPPB) is then the free concentration // of the drug."
vitro,MIC_Erdman,MIC Erdman Strain,"Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Erdman strain. // This is the minimum drug concentration that inhibits the growth // of the bacteria, in this case the Erdman strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
vitro,MICserumErd,MIC Erdman Strain with Serum,"Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Erdman Strain WITH // serum added (serum added demonstrates a more similar to the // environment the drug acts in, in-vivo)."
vitro,MIC_Rv,MIC Rv Strain,MIC for H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis.
vitro,Caseum_binding,Caseum Binding,fraction of drug concentration that is bound to the constituents // of the caseum (caseum is at the center of the necrotic granuloma) (% unbound)
vitro,MacUptake,Macrophage Uptake (Ratio),rate of uptake of drug molecules by macrophages. (I/E concentration ratio). // MacUptake is unitless (I / E concentration ratio)--this could refer to // concentrations inside and outside the macrophage I intracellular / E extracellular. // The time at which the measurement is taken is probably a standard one.
drug,drug,Drug,The drug being tested
drug,dosage,Drug Dosage,The dosage of adminstered drug
drug,dose_int,Dosage Interval,"When the dose is adminstered (QD reflects once // per day, and BID reflects twice per day)"
drug,level,Level of Drug,"The level the drug was measured.(Either occurs at // the highest level (cmax), or lowest level (trough)"
