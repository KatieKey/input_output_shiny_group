#### efficacy_function cleans raw efficacy data in Shiny app
# Function Title: Cleaning Efficacy Dataframe

# This function uses the file input from the fileInput widget for "efficacy" as the argument. 
# The dataframe explores lung and spleen efficacies by drug, days of treatment, and dosage. The function 
# cleans the plasma dataframe by first removing columns that are repeating (i.e., units) and putting
# the efficacy values into a log value for easier comprehension. Further, the dosage and days_treatment columns
# were cleaned by changing the factor names in order to compare by dosage and include controls in this analysis.

##### tissue_std_pk_function cleans raw tissue std pk data in Shiny app

#Function Title: Clean STD PK Dataframe
#The argument for this function contains information on pharmacokinetic properties of the 
#drugs tested on a mouse-by-mouse level. A mouse id was created as a new column to the
#dataset. Additionally, only the necessary columns were included in the dataframe. The spread
#function was used to convert the Comparment column into columns for each compartment, 
#containing the respective Parent values. These new columns were then renamed to match the 
#SLE and SLU variable names in the tidy data templates and recoded as numerical values.

tissue_std_pk_function <- function(tissue_std_pk_df){
