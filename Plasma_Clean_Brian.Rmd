Here I will read in the excel file
```{r read excel file}
plasma <- read_xlsx("data/Gates_18_MALDI_Plasma R.xlsx") 
```

```{r clean the plasma file}
clean_plasma <- plasma %>%
  select(MouseID, 
         Compound, 
         Group, 
         Protocol_Animal, 
         Dosing, 
         Timepoint, 
         Plasma_Parent) %>%
  rename(drug = Compound, 
         mouse_number = MouseID, 
         plasma_concentration = Plasma_Parent)
```

```{r clean_plasma to csv}
write_csv(clean_plasma, path = paste0("CSV_Files/clean_plasma.csv"))
