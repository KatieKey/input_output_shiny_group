##### tissue_std_pk_function cleans raw tissue std pk data in Shiny app

#Function Title: Clean STD PK Dataframe
#The argument for this function contains information on pharmacokinetic properties of the 
#drugs tested on a mouse-by-mouse level. A mouse id was created as a new column to the
#dataset. Additionally, only the necessary columns were included in the dataframe. The spread
#function was used to convert the Comparment column into columns for each compartment, 
#containing the respective Parent values. These new columns were then renamed to match the 
#SLE and SLU variable names in the tidy data templates and recoded as numerical values.

tissue_std_pk_function <- function(tissue_std_pk_df){
  tissue_std_pk_clean <- tissue_std_pk_df %>% 
    mutate(mouse_number = MouseID) %>%
    select(Compound, mouse_number, Drug_Dose, Dose_Frequency, Group, 
           Protocol_Animal, Dosing, Timepoint, Compartment, Parent) %>%
    rename(drug = Compound,
           `Parent [ng/ml]` = Parent) %>% 
    spread(key = Compartment, value = `Parent [ng/ml]`) %>% 
    rename(SLU = Lung, 
           SLE = Lesion) %>% 
    mutate_at(c("SLU", "SLE"), as.numeric)
  return(tissue_std_pk_clean)
}
