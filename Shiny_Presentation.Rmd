##Outline for Presentation:

1. Rationale for what we did
2. Idea development
3. Overview of datasets and tidying process
4. Shiny app development
5. Challenges
6. What we would do differently
7. Interesting
8. Conclusions

########################

## Our group was tasked with:

- loading original Excel files from the research group into R
- cleaning the data into "tidy" formats
- developing an R Shiny App that displays summaries of the clean data and
  displays graphs created by the other groups

########################

##Data sets:

- Efficacy (Katie)
- Plasma (Brian)
- Tissue Laser (Lizette)
- Tissue Standard PK (Elle)

########################

##Shiny App



```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}



```

########################


## Challenges
- differences between spreadsheets  
- what information research group wanted  
- Shiny app  

########################

##Do Differently
- communicate with research group earlier on  
- communicate with other groups for efficiency  

########################

##Interesting Things In Data
- one mouse can only be used for so many measurements  



########################

##Conclusion
- how real world data is not always tidy  
- reward to create the Shiny app
